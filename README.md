# Signalis Menu Screen
An attempt to recreate the Signalis Menu screen using HTML so I could use it as a wallpaper(also so I could try my hand at HTML). It's my first real project using HTML or Javascript so forgive me for any imperfections.
Most of the assets were images of the in-game menu screen I grabbed off google and edited a bit. It's a simple eye that will follow your mouse around, unlike the menu in-game the eyelid doesn't move but it's something I want to add at a later date

Also, play Signalis

## How to use as wallpaper
 1. intall lively wallpaper(becaue I'm broke and don't want to buy wallpaper engine)
 2. click the "add wallpaper" button in the top right corner
 3. click "Chose a file"
 4. find and select "index.html"
